issues:
    1. searchDropDown not working on search page...due to presetting value?
		- works now, api issue
		- but need to be careful as it can be very slow to type since it is waiting for api response
		- may have to change to not due api calls every time a letter changes in real world
    2. Make sure all searchDropDowns work as expected, don't crash, etc.
		- in progress
    3. . potential bug when logging in/out from search page
    4. error messages prevent you from the see more buttons on search page
    5. fix input on search inputs to max at 250
    left off:
        - fix the above items
        - Make sure everything on search page works as expected.....
        - then fix css for different screen sizes
    6. make sure search page child componenets not rendering too much...
