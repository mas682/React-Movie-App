issues:
	1. when doing search from search page, does not rerender '
		- works from search bar
		- issue is when going directly to localhost:3000/search
			- does not fully render...
    2. searchDropDown not working on search page...due to presetting value?
		- works now, api issue
		- but need to be careful as it can be very slow to type since it is waiting for api response
		- may have to change to not due api calls every time a letter changes in real world
    3. Make sure all searchDropDowns work as expected, don't crash, etc.
		- in progress
	4. when value cleared in search bar on search page, still holds old value in url
	5. when you change the type in the url doesn't work?
