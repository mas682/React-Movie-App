issues:
    1. searchDropDown not working on search page...due to presetting value?
		- works now, api issue
		- but need to be careful as it can be very slow to type since it is waiting for api response
		- may have to change to not due api calls every time a letter changes in real world
    2. Make sure all searchDropDowns work as expected, don't crash, etc.
		- in progress
    3. Alerts not getting cleared on search page
	4. when changing pages from the header and the search bar is open, it does not close the
	search screen
    5. potential bug when logging in/out from search page
    6. error messages prevent you from clicking anything on search page
    7. top of menu buttons not clickable...
