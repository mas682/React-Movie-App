To do list:

    To do:
    1. Will want to limit query to only so many results for review posts
        - can be done using limit: number I think?
        - if load more hit, want to upload more
    2. Will want to reroute to this page on login
        - done but may move to somewhere else eventually
    3. also want to show timing of post on movie post
        - done
    4. notice using user profile css on userFeed.js
    5. add status codes to login requests
    6. need to fix following on users pages so that if you follow it is blue when you go
      to it after switching pages
        - done
    7. also handle the case where the user is going to their own page
        - done but may want to fix formatting of user header when follow button not there
        - could just add a css rule that formats header differently
    8. Make user names hyperlinks to their pages
        - done on movie posts
        - done on comments but need to fix issue where a user clicks on their own
          but does not cause the movie posts pop up to close because the state doesn't
          change
    9. Make posts editable by user who posted
      - made it so that there is a edit button on posts if the username for the post
        matches the username passed into the movie post
          - may have to handle this differently in future, such as keeping which user
          is logged in in higher up state
      - next need to make popup for editing similar to review popup
    10. Make comments editable by user who posted and users post
    11. Make a user setting page
    12. May want to make user pages private
    13. set up api to get movies and store in db
    14. add logout functionality
    15. password reset functionality
    16. add functionality to list followers, following
    17. add functionality to search for users, through friends lists and general
    18. figure out how to do common friends
    19. add profile pictures for users
    20. Notifications for new followers, comments, etc.

    22. add timestamps to comments
        - done
    23. Not sure if adding comments to a post is fully implemented yet?
