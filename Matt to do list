To do list:

    To do:
    1. Will want to limit query to only so many results for review posts
        - can be done using limit: number I think?
        - if load more hit, want to upload more
    2. Will want to reroute to this page on login
        - done but may move to somewhere else eventually
    3. also want to show timing of post on movie post
        - done
    4. notice using user profile css on userFeed.js

    7. also handle the case where the user is going to their own page
        - done but may want to fix formatting of user header when follow button not there
        - could just add a css rule that formats header differently
    8. Make user names hyperlinks to their pages
        - done on movie posts
        - done on comments but need to fix issue where a user clicks on their own
          but does not cause the movie posts pop up to close because the state doesn't
          change
    9. Make posts editable by user who posted
      - made it so that there is a edit button on posts if the username for the post
        matches the username passed into the movie post
          - may have to handle this differently in future, such as keeping which user
          is logged in in higher up state
      - next need to make popup for editing similar to review popup

    26. make a message pop up when you logout or attempt to do something when not logged in..
    27. fix rendering on landing page as small bug where if you go to settings when not logged in
        and then close it, open sign up, close that...login pop up will be back open due to landing
        rendering again..

    29. on user feed page, when nothing to show, notify user
        - also change path to just feed
    30. need to change users to indicate if regular user or admin
    31. then let admin do things like remove posts, add/remove users, edit users settings, etc.

        - also fix how date is stored in database..
    33. make review form query database when user is entering movie name
        - then once the user selects the movie, show the image
        - also store the movie id to pass to db...
   34. will then have to update moviePost to show correct movie image..
   35. then create individual pages for movies
   36. create a page that can be found on a movie page that shows the reviews associated
       with the movie..
  37. fix error handling on review form submission
  38. make it so that suggestions in seach drop down make letters that match in bold..
    - will need algorithm?
  39. Put SearchDropDown styling in it's own css file..
  40. need to add a ton of error handling to database side, using .catch()
      - tons of issues in reviews.js with creating reviews
      - issue associating users with tags as can use any integer...
  41. need to fix updating movie as it is still set to update the title,
      but could be complications with having to switch movies completely in
      the database..
  42. fix reviewform to let you post review with just id
          - done but needs fixed for update form(see 41)
  43. make sure only returning 10 entries..
  44. fix bug where others are suggested when you first click after selected

  45. need to verify movie exists when creating review
          - somewhat handled by catch but not sure if this is the best way?
  46. make review form scrollable..
        -done
        - should probably put this in it's own css file to be used by movie post pop up and
        - review form
  47. note: underscores in postres need to be replaced with \\_ or it will return everything
      when doing pattern matching only
  48. need to make a movie watchlist page
      - on movie posts, add button to add movie to watch list?
  49. need to make a favorite movies page


  next steps:
    - working on implement search bar in header
        - style options...
            - on search button click:
                - make it 50% of header, remove profile, settings, logout?
                - wipe out everything in header
                - just leave in right corner
                - put it below everything in header...
    - fix findByTitle in Movies.js model to break queries into individual pieces like you did in users.js
        - be careful with underscores
    - then fix movies.js to work how users.js model has seperate functions...

    movie page:
        - at some point, need to fix ratings on the page
            - keep track of 2 numbers: current total ratings, number of ratings
            - divide one by the other
            - when updating rating, will have to subtract and then update with new value
        - need to handle case where no image exists, just show something? such as no image found?
        - do something similar for trailer too
        - make title on page hyperlink to movies site if applicable
            - https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/577922-tenet
            - can either use the homepage field from the get movie details api
            - or use the movie db's website and just do /movie/id
        - fix css as container named overviewContainer but used for several things
        - fix movie reviews so that clicking on picture leads to movies page
            - done on movie posts
        - acccount for null poster, trailer, or background image
              - background image done
              - trailer done
        - may want a table for directors, and then associate directors with movies
              - then on director click, find movies associated
              - consider doing this with actors as well but down the line..
        - on genre click, find movies with that genre
            - for background, if poster available could use that?
            - do in future
        - with reviewform, it is very hard to redirect as you have it set up
            - have to remove review form pop up but can't do that until you redirect....
            - may just not do this
        - want a button on a movies page to write review
            - if not logged in, prompt to sign in

      GOAL IS TO BUILD SMALLEST FUNCTIONAL SITE POSSIBLE NOW, THEN EXPAND LATER
      - current plan(accomplish one small thing at a time):
          - finish the search bar
              - need to set up queries for movies
              - redirect to user/movie page on suggestion click
              - full on search page
              - ability to search just off text, ignore suggestions
          - then add functionality to have a watch list
              - let users add movies to watch list from movie page
              - let users add movies to watch list from movie posts
              - view all movies on watch list
              - try to make it reusable for favorites
          - then add functionality for favorites
              - similar to steps above for watch list
          - create search page to search by genre, movie, user, etc.
              - leave functionality general enough to add directors, actors, etc. to it
          - fix upcoming, top rated, in theaters pages
          - fix anything in the above sections that is still not done after this


          left off:
            testing search bar for movie review form to use update function
            - was doing te and then deleting it to see if it worked
            - test other scenarios
            - fixed the following:
                - updateFunction not called unless defined in search drop down

                - redirect not called for review form


      Search bar
        - steal idea form imdb in which they let you choose a drop down of what to search from
        - issue where you hit enter on a value, go to that page, and the value is still there
            - when you press enter with the value still there, issue at line 304..
        - need to fix issue where state for redirect changed from true to false and causes render
        - break key pressed handler function into smaller functions
    Movie Filter Pages
        - need to try to prevent bad requests on client side
        - also need to fix component will receive props when going from one filter page to another
        - add filter, sort options to the page somewhere

                    - in progress
                    - need to clean up a lot of the code
                    - prevent bad requests
                    - prevent values that have arrays such as 2 dates lte
                    - also want to add option to include or not include movies I've watched
            - do not worry about doing genre does not equal...
                - only worried about movies that CONTAIN that genre

            - after you clean up movie page api
                - start making user watch list page
                - also make a page for movies I've watched
