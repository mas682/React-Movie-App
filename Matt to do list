To do list:

    To do:
    1. Will want to limit query to only so many results for review posts
        - can be done using limit: number I think?
        - if load more hit, want to upload more

    8. Make user names hyperlinks to their pages
        - done on movie posts
        - done on comments but need to fix issue where a user clicks on their own
          but does not cause the movie posts pop up to close because the state doesn't
          change
    9. Make posts editable by user who posted
      - made it so that there is a edit button on posts if the username for the post
        matches the username passed into the movie post
          - may have to handle this differently in future, such as keeping which user
          is logged in in higher up state

    27. fix rendering on landing page as small bug where if you go to settings when not logged in
        and then close it, open sign up, close that...login pop up will be back open due to landing
        rendering again..

    29. on user feed page, when nothing to show, notify user
        - also change path to just feed

       with the movie..
  37. fix error handling on review form submission
  38. make it so that suggestions in seach drop down make letters that match in bold..
    - will need algorithm?
  39. Put SearchDropDown styling in it's own css file..
  40. need to add a ton of error handling to database side, using .catch()
      - tons of issues in reviews.js with creating reviews
      - issue associating users with tags as can use any integer...
  41. need to fix updating movie as it is still set to update the title,
      but could be complications with having to switch movies completely in

          - somewhat handled by catch but not sure if this is the best way?
  46. make review form scrollable..

        - should probably put this in it's own css file to be used by movie post pop up and

      when doing pattern matching only

      - on movie posts, add button to add movie to watch list?
  49. need to make a favorite movies page


  next steps:
    - working on implement search bar in header
        - style options...
            - on search button click:
                - make it 50% of header, remove profile, settings, logout?
                - wipe out everything in header
                - just leave in right corner
                - put it below everything in header...
    - fix findByTitle in Movies.js model to break queries into individual pieces like you did in users.js
        - be careful with underscores
    - then fix movies.js to work how users.js model has seperate functions...

    movie page:
        - at some point, need to fix ratings on the page
            - keep track of 2 numbers: current total ratings, number of ratings
            - divide one by the other
            - when updating rating, will have to subtract and then update with new value
        - need to handle case where no image exists, just show something? such as no image found?
        - do something similar for trailer too
        - make title on page hyperlink to movies site if applicable
            - https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/577922-tenet
            - can either use the homepage field from the get movie details api
            - or use the movie db's website and just do /movie/id
        - fix css as container named overviewContainer but used for several things
        - fix movie reviews so that clicking on picture leads to movies page
            - done on movie posts
        - acccount for null poster, trailer, or background image
              - background image done
              - trailer done
        - may want a table for directors, and then associate directors with movies
              - then on director click, find movies associated
              - consider doing this with actors as well but down the line..
        - on genre click, find movies with that genre
            - for background, if poster available could use that?
            - do in future
        - with reviewform, it is very hard to redirect as you have it set up
            - have to remove review form pop up but can't do that until you redirect....
            - may just not do this
        - want a button on a movies page to write review
            - if not logged in, prompt to sign in

      GOAL IS TO BUILD SMALLEST FUNCTIONAL SITE POSSIBLE NOW, THEN EXPAND LATER
      - current plan(accomplish one small thing at a time):
          - finish the search bar
              - need to set up queries for movies
              - redirect to user/movie page on suggestion click
              - full on search page
              - ability to search just off text, ignore suggestions
          - create search page to search by genre, movie, user, etc.
              - leave functionality general enough to add directors, actors, etc. to it
          - fix upcoming, top rated, in theaters pages
          - fix anything in the above sections that is still not done after this


          left off:
            testing search bar for movie review form to use update function
            - was doing te and then deleting it to see if it worked
            - test other scenarios
            - fixed the following:
                - updateFunction not called unless defined in search drop down
                - when searchign for a value that is not a match, set update function to undefined
                - need to movie movie query into search file
                - redirect not called for review form


    Search bar
        - steal idea form imdb in which they let you choose a drop down of what to search from
        - issue where you hit enter on a value, go to that page, and the value is still there
            - when you press enter with the value still there, issue at line 304..
        - need to fix issue where state for redirect changed from true to false and causes render
        - break key pressed handler function into smaller functions

        - may want to have button click show movie pop up like watch list, watched list do
        - need to add a way to easily add the movie to watch list/watched list
        - may want to put a hint on poster in pop up to let users know click to go to movie page

        - may want to add movies you've reviewed to your watched list
    movie display pop up
        - may want to put a hint on poster in pop up to let users know click to go to movie page
        - going to not add movie watch list buttons to the movie post pop up as do not want this to be
        too big, also can be found by clicking off of post

    header
        - add a button for users
        - combine profile and settings into one buttons group

    - login pop up
        - on movie filter pages, made it so that this does not cause a full page rerender
        - also does not reroute to a different page on login, but causes rerender
        - may want to do this on other pages instead of doing it thorugh the header
            - on login click from header, pass a prop to child to indicate to show the pop up
        - fix css so that text aligned to left for content field...
            - specifically for movie post that causes it to show
    - movie post:
        - fix sign in pop up from header
            - issue: not getting the username passed to the child components so they don't update
            - as they don't see the change...

            - working on movie info pages
                - done
            - build alert component like https://material-ui.com/components/alert/

            - need to fix movie filter pages to utilize the Alert component

            from gaining focus
            - working on Profileheader and MoviePostDisplay
            - fix bug for clearing messages when going from one users page to another
                - if messages still up on first page, and then go to another, messages come up but clear quickly?
                    - done but make sure working on all pages..
            - need to fix login
                - when doing this, also make it so that router calls login on mount so that it knows who is logged in before
                it event renders the components...
                - done but needs cleaned up

            - on all pages, need to update loggedInUser as it comes in so that when the props come down again,
            you do not update if you already have the right user

                - will need to have one inside outter class, and one inside of movie post displays
                - remove success message in UserResultsHandlers after doing this as you know it
                succeeded if the icon color changed

        - something to consider: when a user adds a movie to their watch list through their friends posts,
        if another one of their friends also reviewed the movie down the line, it will not show up immediately..
            - may want to remove this option'
            - new plan: make the movie pop up like on movie pages and show the buttons from there, remove
            them from the post itself as difficult to handle
