# React Movie App (MovieFanatics)

## Overview
This project started around June 2020 with the intent of building a web application in which users can rate movies and share it with their friends.  There were a few reasons for building the project.  The first reason is I wanted to just have fun building something that I wanted to build.  In the past, just about all of my project have been something for work or school in which there were some sort of guidelines for what I was building.  The second reason is that I wanted to learn new technologies and tools that I have never used before.  Prior to this project, I had no previous experience with React or Express.js, and I also had limited prior exposure to technologies such as Docker and PostgreSQL.  Lastly, I wanted to put together everything I have learned over the years into one project to see what I could build.  Overall, I can say I have thoroughly enjoyed building this project.  I have been able to learn things I have never knew while also being tasked with challenges that I could have never anticipated.  I think the project has and will continue to make me a better software developer as well as continue to push me to places I have never gone before.
